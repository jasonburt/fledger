This is the **Skills Assessment Matrix**.
You can make notes outside of the table and you can also make notes in the table in the **notes** column.
The **example** section is updated by running a search request to create a record, and then an update command.

```sh
fledger search 'README*' --search-type=file --save=user --category=Basics --subcategory=Documentation
```

```sh
fledger update-skill-assesment
```
