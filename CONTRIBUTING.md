## Getting started
To Develop on Fledger you will need an environment with git and python.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with Fledger, search if an issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a
relevant [issue
template](https://github.com/jasonburt/fledger/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing
issues](https://github.com/jasonburt/fledger/issues) to find one that
interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as
filters. By default, we won't assign issues to any contributors that
are not maintainers. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome
to open a PR with a fix.

Important Labels:

- **Good First Issue** - These are a good entry point for contributing
  to Fledger.

- **Help Wanted** - These are issues we are looking for the community
  to help contribute to.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2.

5. Test your changes locally.

6. If possible, add a test that will run with CI. ðŸ™‡

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Be sure to [sign your
commit](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-organization#about-commit-signoffs)
if using the command line interface.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Apply the "Ready for review" label so that we can review your PR.
  This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the
  purpose of your pull request.

- Don't forget to [link PR to
  issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.

- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer
  edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge.

  Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your
  proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional
  information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either
  using [suggested
  changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly
  through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then
  commit them to your branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
  [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git
  tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help
  you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The Fledger community thanks you! âœ¨

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be included in the
next release ðŸ˜„. See the [release process
docs](https://github.com/jasonburt/fledger/blob/main/RELEASE.md) for
more information on how that is managed. A maintainer will run the
release.
