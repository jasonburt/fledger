# Fledger
Fledging is the stage in a flying animal's life between hatching or birth and becoming capable of flight.

Fledger's goal is to use real world open source projects and open source standards / best practices to help software engineers with their general career. We hope as this helps you will  learn, grow, and contribute to the community.

## High Level Areas Fledger covers.

- Documentation (READMEs, Legal, Guides, CheatSheets)
- Release Notes
- Security

### Getting Started

**For Job Seeks

Below are a number of categories, each category has an overview, interview guide, and how to work with partner teams in that category. The categories are basic prep, intended to be very light. Once you have tried it you can apply it for specific roles or companies you are interested in. You will have a better understanding to talk with a potential employer, an artifact that you went through, and it will set you up for you first 30-60-90 days as well as working with other teams.

Below are a set of Categories written in partnership with Industry experts, pick a category you are interested in to get started.

- [[SECURITY_CATEGORY]] - v1
- Usability - coming soon
- Accessibility - coming soon
- Quality - coming soon

**For Internal Teams**
Fledger can be used to help onboard, train, and support team members. More to come. : )
